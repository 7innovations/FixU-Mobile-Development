# FixU Mobile Development

FixU is a mobile application designed to help users detect and manage their mental health, with a specific focus on depression detection. The app utilizes deep learning algorithms, cloud integration, and an intuitive mobile interface to provide a seamless, user-friendly, and reliable experience.

## Mobile Features Developed

- **Cloud Authentication for Login**
  - Secure login and registration via cloud authentication to ensure user privacy and data protection.

- **Depression Detection System**
  - Users can select their status as "Professional" or "Student."
  - Custom questions are presented based on the chosen status.
  - Responses are collected through various input formats (radio buttons, text fields, etc).
  - Data is processed using a deep learning model that is deployed in the cloud.
  - Personalized diagnostic results are generated based on the userâ€™s inputs.

- **Dairy Notes with Reminders**
  - Users can create personal notes by tapping a floating action button.
  - Created notes are stored in the cloud and can be accessed at any time.
  - Daily reminders can be enabled for mental health activities.
  - Custom reminder times can be set based on user preferences.

- **Dark Mode Support**
  - Toggle between light and dark themes using a Material Switch.
  - User preferences are saved, and the theme is applied automatically when the app restarts.

- **Bottom Navigation Bar**
  - Simple and intuitive navigation with sections for Home, Diagnose, Diary Notes, and Profile.

## Technical Specifications

- **Languages and Frameworks**: Kotlin, Android Studio, Retrofit, Room Database.
- **UI Libraries**: Material Design, Glide (image loading).
- **Theme Management**: Material3 with custom Base.Theme.fixu.
- **Data Storage**: Room Database (local) and Cloud API for question-answer processing.
- **Deep Learning**: Depression detection using a custom-trained on-cloud DL model.
- **Cloud Integration**: APIs deployed in the cloud for backend processing.

## Project Structure

- **Mobile Development**: UI/UX design and integration with APIs.
- **Deep Learning**: Creation and evaluation of the depression detection model.
- **Cloud Computing**: API development and deployment for backend data processing.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/7innovations/FixU-Mobile-Development
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Sync the Gradle files
4. Set up your endpoint services in `local.properties`
5. Add a property named `BASE_URL` in `local.properties`
6. Rebuild the project
7. Set the correct API URL in `ApiService`
8. Run the application on an emulator or a physical device

### How to Connect the App to Firebase
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. **Create a project** and **register** the app with your Firebase project
3. Download `google-services.json` and place it in the root **app** folder
4. Add the required dependencies and plugins to your Gradle files
5. **Sync Gradle**

### How to Enable Firebase Authentication
1. Go to your Firebase project in the Firebase Console
2. Navigate to **Build -> Authentication**
3. Enable the **Email/Password provider** under the sign-in method
4. Make sure your `build.gradle` files have these dependencies
   - **Gradle Project**
   ```gradle
   plugins {
     ...
     id("com.google.gms.google-services") version "4.4.2" apply false
   }
   ```
   - **Gradle Module**
   ```gradle
   plugins {
     ...
     id("com.google.gms.google-services")
   }
   dependencies {
     ...
     implementation(platform("com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:33.7.0"))
     implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-auth")
   }
   ```

6. **Sync Gradle** if you made changes to your Gradle files.

## How It Works

### Depression Detection Flow
1. The user selects their status (Professional or Student).
2. A series of 10 tailored questions are presented based on the selected status.
3. The answers are compiled into an array and sent to the cloud.
4. The machine learning model processes the data and returns a diagnosis.
5. The app displays the diagnostic results with actionable insights.

### Diary Notes Flow
- Users can add notes by tapping the floating action button (FAB).
- Upon confirmation, the data is sent to the backend API and saved in the cloud database.
- The application retrieves and displays the list of notes stored in the cloud.

### Dark Mode
- User preferences for dark mode are stored in **SharedPreferences**.
- The theme can be toggled in the **Profile** section, and the setting is applied automatically at app restart.

## Future Enhancements

- **Consultation Feature**: Provide recommendations based on diagnosis results to mental health professionals.
- **Health Tips**: Offer actionable mental health suggestions based on diagnostic results.
- **Community Integration**: Facilitate connections between users and mental health professionals.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Expand the app to support additional languages for broader accessibility.
